## Background

Trauma is a glaring threat to public health globally, resulting in millions of deaths each year (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more people die from trauma than from malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality combined. Almost 90% of trauma deaths have been found to occur in low- and middle-income countries. A majority of these deaths are due to road traffic injuries, primarily affecting those aged 19-29, making traumatic injuries the leading killer of young people globally (2).

Whereas the number of deaths due to trauma is substantial, the incidence of non-fatal trauma is also considerable with almost half a billion cases annually globally (3). As trauma (both fatal and non-fatal) disproportionately affects the young, it therefore affects the working population in a country to a large degree, leading to a considerable loss of work days. Furthermore, trauma in many cases also leads to psychiatric problems, PTSD and PTSD-like symptoms. This further compounds the blow caused by traumatic injuries to the already heavily affected workforce (4).

A substantial body of research indicates that the implementation of trauma systems may substantially reduce trauma mortality (5, 6). A trauma system (depending on its design) may be implemented to improve a specific part of the trauma care, such as pre-hospital care or registration of patients. Trauma systems have previously been implemented successfully: In 2007 a publication revealed a large portion of trauma patients in the United Kingdom (UK) received substandard trauma care (7). In response to this several trauma networks i.e. trauma systems were implemented, which significantly improved trauma outcome in terms of mortality (8).

One of the most important components of trauma systems is a trauma registry, or a trauma data bank (9). The data bank is used to track trauma patients and their outcomes to facilitate trauma surveillance and research. Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO), Swedish Trauma Registry (SweTrau) and National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) are examples of registries currently in use. All of these have been used in trauma research, contributing to clinical guidelines and improved patient care – and ultimately to reduced trauma mortality and morbidity (10-12).

This project proposes to implement a trauma data bank at [REPLACE WITH CENTRE NAME], with the aim to collect the absolute latest available trauma data for use in research or institutional quality improvement programs.

## Methods

#### Design
Data bank implementation.

#### Setting

Hospitals that receive trauma patients.

#### Participants
**Eligibility criteria**

Patients who present to the emergency department of participating hospitals with history of trauma. History of trauma is defined as having any of the International Classification of Diseases version 10 external causes of morbidity and mortality, codes V01-Y36, as reason for presenting.

**Sources and methods of selection of participants**

Participants will be enrolled and data will be collected by dedicated research officers who work five eight hour shifts per week according to a rotating schedule so that morning, evening and nights shifts are covered. The project officers will approach potential participants for enrollment during their emergency department stay. In addition to this the project officers will collect data of all patients with burns as the mechanism of injury (ICD codes X00-X19, X75-X77, X96-X98) and admitted anytime in the day irrespective of their shift.

**Methods of follow up**

Participants will be followed up at the emergency department or on hospital discharge and at 24 hours, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months. If a participant is still admitted he or she will be followed up in person, otherwise there will be telephone follow ups.

#### Variables

-	All-cause mortality at discharge, 24 hours, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months after arrival to participating hospital
-	Date and time of death, up until 12 months after arrival to participating hospitals
-	Health related quality of life
-	Return to work
-	Demographic variables
-	Mechanism of injury
-	Vital signs
-	Comorbidities
-	Investigations
-	Injury descriptions
-	Burns specific data like TBSA with depth of burns, inhalational burns, household burns etc

#### Data sources

Vital signs will be recorded by the project officers using hand held equipment when participants arrive to the emergency department. Demographics and follow up will be collected from participants, participant parties, and hospital records. Procedure data will be collected from hospital health care providers and hospital records.

#### Ethical considerations

This data bank will be implemented and maintained following the four core principles of medical ethics, i.e. respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice.

**Respect for autonomy**

Patients included in the trauma data bank will receive a letter detailing the purpose and procedures. They are informed that participation is voluntary, and that they may withdraw at any time regardless of reason.

**Non-maleficence**

Patient data leakage and patient identification are the most significant risks to the patient population. The data collected will be stored in a locked cabinet to which only relevant personal has access. When data is transferred, all secondary storage devices (e.g. hard drives) will be password protected and encrypted. These actions will be undertaken to minimize these risks to the patient population.

**Beneficence**

The intention of this data bank is to provide data for future research and quality improvement in the field of trauma and trauma care. This research will in turn hopefully improve trauma outcomes by improving trauma patient care and trauma patient management.

**Justice**

All patients included in this study were treated regardless of age, sex, or prior medical history. Patients received the same level of care whether they choose to participate in the data bank or not.

**Data management**

Project officers will first capture data on paper case record forms. These forms will be archived in a locked cabinet at the centre to which only the principal investigator and the project officers have access. The forms will be archived for as long as required by national and local rules and regulations require. Data will then be transferred from the paper case record forms to a digital database. A database with patient identifiers will be kept locally on the project officers and principal investigators’ hard drives. This database will be encrypted and password protected. The project officers will update the digital database after each follow up. With regular intervals the database will be de-identified locally. In de-identification process all patient and centre identifiers will be removed. The
de-identified database will then be merged with databases from other centres that also have implemented a data bank using the same system. This merged de-identified database will then be available in an open public repository, called the Open Trauma Data Bank. Use of the de-identified database for any purpose will be subject to a license that prohibits any attempt at re-identification of patients or centres.
